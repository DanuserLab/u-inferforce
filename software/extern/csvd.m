%CSVD Compact singular value decomposition.
%
% s = csvd(A)
% [U,s,V] = csvd(A)
% [U,s,V] = csvd(A,'full')
%
% Computes the compact form of the SVD of A:
%    A = U*diag(s)*V',
% where
%    U  is  m-by-min(m,n)
%    s  is  min(m,n)-by-1
%    V  is  n-by-min(m,n).
%
% If a second argument is present, the full U and V are returned.
