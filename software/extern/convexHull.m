function [hull, inds] = convexHull(points)
%CONVEXHULL Convex hull of a set of points
%
%   POLY = convexHull(POINTS)
%   Computes the convex hull of the set of points POINTS. This function is
%   mainly a wrapper to the convhull function, that format the result to a
%   polygon.
%
%   [POLY INDS] = convexHull(POINTS)
%   Also returns the indices of convex hull vertices within the original
%   array of points.
%
%   Example
%     % Draws the convex hull of a set of random points
%     pts = rand(30,2);
%     drawPoint(pts, '.');
%     hull = convexHull(pts);
%     hold on; 
%     drawPolygon(hull);
%
%     % Draws the convex hull of a paper hen
%     x = [0 10 20  0 -10 -20 -10 -10  0];
%     y = [0  0 10 10  20  10  10  0 -10];
%     poly = [x' y'];
%     hull = convexHull(poly);
%     figure; drawPolygon(poly);
%     hold on; axis equal;
%     drawPolygon(hull, 'm');
