% The following implementation suffers problems at the field boundary when basis
% functions (e.g. with insufficient support) are disregarded. The
% interpolation of the solution in these boundary regions is not always correct
% since the triangulation might be different from the initial triangulation
% saved in forceMesh.dt. This results from simply appending the zero nodes at
% the end of the non-zero nodes. However, this problem occurs only
% at the boundary but not inside the domain. This "minor" problem has been
% solved by both implementations above:


% pos=vertcat(forceMesh.basis(:).node);
% vec=horzcat(sol_coef(1:forceMesh.numBasis),sol_coef(forceMesh.numBasis+1:end));
% 
% % append the zero nodes:
% if isfield(forceMesh,'zeroNodes')
%     pos=vertcat(pos,forceMesh.zeroNodes);
%     vec=vertcat(vec,zeros(size(forceMesh.zeroNodes)));
% end
