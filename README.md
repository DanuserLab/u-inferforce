u-inferforce (previous named Traction Force Microscopy or TFM) is a MATLAB software that reconstructs traction forces of cells adhered on elastic gel doped with beads. The software quantifies the deformation of the gel by image-based tracking of the beads from pairs of images, one displaying in the deformed and displaying the relaxed substrate. Traction force reconstruction is accomplished via L1-regularization, which is particularly good for identifying traction from small adhesions. It generates traction magnitude heat-maps as well as traction vector fields as outputs. The software additionally supports conventional L2-based BEM (Boundary Element Method) and FTTC (Fourier Transform Traction Cytometry).

The innovative parts of the reconstruction algorithms are published in [**Traction microscopy to identify force modulation in subresolution adhesions**](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3430), *Nature Methods*, 2015, 12, 653â€“656, written by Sangyoon J Han, Youbean Oak, Alex Groisman, [Gaudenz Danuser](https://www.danuserlab-utsw.org/).

## Software Updates

TFM (Traction Force Microscopy) has been renamed to **u-inferforce**. Please select **u-inferforce** from the analysis packages list to run the software.
